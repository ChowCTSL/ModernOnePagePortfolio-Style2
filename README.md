## Getting Started

### Project Images

To change the project images, replace the files in the img/portfolio project directory, and refer to them appropriately in the HTML project section.

### Resume Document

To change the resume, replace the file in the documents project directory.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript/jQuery files are located in the /js project directory, including the BootStrap JS components. The ekko-lightbox.js contains the script needed for using the lightbox for the projects section on the portfolio template.  The custom.js contains the addition JavaScript used for the template that can be altered to fit your needs.  


## Motivation

This project was created to provide others with a template that had a modern take, yet has the common sections for a portfolio website.  This template was created so that it could be modified easily, even by those with little experience with creating websites.
